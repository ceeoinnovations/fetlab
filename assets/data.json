This works by training the motor. That is how you would code it!!! Done ! "

We investigated low-cost and expressive tangible interfaces that foster computational literacy. <br><br> Draw2Code is a paper-based tangible computational kit for young children to create an interactive 2D augmented reality animation. Children use Draw2Code to make their paper drawing alive as an animated virtual sprite and control it using hand gestures. Engaging with the kit, children can design, code, and play with their creations. It exposes children to basic programming concepts through playful and tangible interaction."
